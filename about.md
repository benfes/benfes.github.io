# About Me
Hey, I'm a developer with a passion for the web. I currently work at Seekom, in Wellington, New Zealand.


## Experience
I've worked in a wide array of areas within the web sector ranging from instructing and support to finance through to accommodation.

I've previously worked in London for deko(previously pay4later) and was one of the lead developers helping to get the startup from a 7 person crew to 30 (when I left the company).

## Other Interests
When I'm not hunched over my keyboard, you will generally find me behind a guitar. I spend a lot of my free time trying to tweak my skills on the instrument.

My other passion is building, from lego through to woodworking. This kinda goes hand in hand with the whole developer side of my life.
